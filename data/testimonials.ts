        "100% would recommend Kenzerama Productions! My husband and I hired them for our wedding back in May and we are completely blown away by the final product! Our wedding video turned out like cinematic magical dream! Kenzie and Theo were absolutely amazing to work with! They were knowledgeable, provided expertise feedback on our ideas and worked with us to create our vision. They were professional, trustworthy, reliable and friendly. We were able to communicate with them seamlessly throughout the whole process. We are so happy with our decision and so grateful for the amazing work that they did!",

      testimonial:
        "Working with Kenzie and Theo made our day even more special. Kenzie’s eye for detail and perfection on getting the perfect shot truly was appreciated and reflected in her work! My (now) husband and I were going back and forth on spending the money on videography, weddings are ridiculously pricey, however now that we have our footage and have video of our vows, funny moments (getting ready with your crew etc) I’m sooooo happy we chose to spend the money and get videography. The day goes so fast and everything is a blur, being able to have the footage of the ceremony and reception was a dream come true. I cry every time I watch our wedding video. (I think I’m at 100+ views, just from me alone) Kenzie & Theo’s personality was the cherry on top to having our special day captured. They are so much fun to work with & so supportive if you are anything like my husband and I who were VERY awkward at first in front of the camera.",

        "I can’t say enough about our wonderful experience with Kenzerama Productions! Kenzie and Theo were our videographers for our wedding, and they went above and beyond our wildest expectations. Their professionalism, paired with their fun and vibrant personalities, made the entire process an absolute joy from start to finish. Right from the beginning, they were so helpful, offering timeline advice and other invaluable tips that ensured our day flowed seamlessly. Throughout the day, Kenzie and Theo were incredibly encouraging and supportive; their enthusiasm was contagious! They constantly complimented us and gave us the confidence to feel completely comfortable and natural in front of the camera. They really know how to make a couple feel fantastic! Their dedication and passion for their craft were evident in every single shot they took. Though our wedding was only a week ago and we haven’t yet received all the footage, they sent us a teaser video that is simply breathtaking! They captured the magic and emotion of our wedding even in a short clip; I have to pick my jaw up off the floor every time I watch it. We are so excited to see the final product! Many things in the wedding process can be sacrificed but I insist this is not one of them; do what you can to budget for this incredibly worthy investment. These are the videos we will have forever, allowing us to enjoy the memory of the best day. Don’t bother looking elsewhere; Kenzerama are unparalleled. We are so grateful we chose to work with such an exceptional team of professionals. Thank you, Kenzie and Theo — our wedding would not have been the same without you!",

        "Where do I even begin? Kenzie and Theo are the most wonderful human beings ever— not only are they so talented at what they do, but they are the most uplifting and friendly people you would want to capture your big day on film. They have a way of capturing the most special and candid moments on film and on drone, we burst with excitement from even just seeing a sneak peak! My husband and I cannot thank you both enough for everything- you are simply the best! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!",
